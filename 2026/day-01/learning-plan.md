- Weekly 6 days plan -1 day revision
-  2hrs weekdays
- 4-6 hrs on weekends
- 3 posts on linkdin everyweek
## My Current Position
- My role is to maintain college web server, deploy application and minimize cost and maximize CPu Utilization.
- Build, Test and Deploy web application using docker

# Three goals towards 90days devops
1. Deploy a production based 3-tier application on K8s
   - A live, scalable app running on k8s Cluster
   - Containerize a full-stack app (React + Node/Nest/Flask + DB)
   - Deploy on EKS (preferred) or GKE
   - Ingress Controller (NGINX / ALB), HPA + resource limits
2. Build a complete CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins or GitHub Actions
   - Every code must be push automatically build, test and deploys
   - Pipeline stages should follow: Lint & test, Build Docker image, Push to ECR / Docker Hub, Deploy to Kubernetes
3. Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting
   - Full visibility into application and cluster health
   - Montioring tools i.e. Grafana dashobards
   - Logging: Loki
   - Alerts: CPU, Memory, Pod restart, HTTP errors

   - Impelment rollback & approvals
2. Containerization & Kubernetes
