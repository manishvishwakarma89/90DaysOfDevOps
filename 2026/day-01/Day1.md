# Day1: Task
Under the guidance of Shubham Londhe Sir, I have started the #90DaysofDevOps challenge.
For the next 90 days, I will be completing day-wise tasks and sharing my learnings consistently.
### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a cultural practice in an organization where the Development and Operations teams collaborate closely by sharing tools, responsibilities, and processes to ensure smooth and faster software delivery.
DevOps focuses on collaboration, communication, and integration among development, operations, and quality assurance teams.
It was introduced to eliminate the traditional gap between these teams and improve efficiency.
