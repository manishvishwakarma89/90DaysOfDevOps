# Day1: Task
Under the guidance of Shubham Londhe Sir, I have started the #90DaysofDevOps challenge.
For the next 90 days, I will be completing day-wise tasks and sharing my learnings consistently.
### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a cultural practice in an organization where the Development and Operations teams collaborate closely by sharing tools, responsibilities, and processes to ensure smooth and faster software delivery.
DevOps focuses on collaboration, communication, and integration among development, operations, and quality assurance teams.
It was introduced to eliminate the traditional gap between these teams and improve efficiency.

### What is Automation?
Automation is the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention.
Automation helps control and manage various processes such as:
- Manufacturing
- Transportation
- Communication Systems
The main goal of automation is to increase efficiency and productivity while reducing manual effort.
Automation can be achieved using technologies like:
- Computer software
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Robots
## What is Scaling?
Scaling refers to increasing the capacity or capability of a system to handle a growing workload or user base.
- Adding more servers or resources
- Implementing load balancing
- Using automation to provision and manage resources efficiently
## Types of Scaling:
- Vertical Scaling
  Increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage.
  Example: Upgrading server hardware.
- Horizontal Scaling
  Increasing capacity by adding more servers to the system.
  Example: Adding multiple servers and distributing traffic using a load balancer.
## What is Infrastructure?
Infrastructure refers to the hardware and software resources required to develop, test, deploy, and run applications.
This includes:
- Servers
- Networks
- Storage
- Cloud Services
- Automation and management tools
Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), organizations can automate infrastructure provisioning and management, resulting in:
- Faster deployments
- Reduced errors
- Better scalability
